Music Playlist Organizer
Description
The Music Playlist Organizer is a database management system (DBMS) project designed to manage music playlists, users, songs, genres, and artists. It allows users to create playlists, add songs to them, and organize their music collection efficiently. The system is built using MySQL to manage the data, with tables for users, artists, songs, genres, playlists, and the relationships between them.

This project features a relational database schema with entities like Users, Artists, Songs, Playlists, and Genres, as well as the relationships between them. The project covers SQL queries, ER diagram, and provides sample data for better demonstration and understanding.

Artists: Store information about various music artists and their songs.

Genres: Categorize songs into various genres (e.g., Pop, Rap, Indie).

Songs: Store details about songs, such as title, duration, release year, artist, and genre.

Playlists: Users can create, view, and modify playlists with songs from various genres and artists.

Technologies Used
Database: MySQL

SQL: Used for writing queries to interact with the database

ER Diagram: Visual representation of the database schema

GitHub: Used for version control and project management
